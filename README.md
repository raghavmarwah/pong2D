# Pong-2D

This is my Grade 12 Computer Science project that I created in 2015. It is based on the PONG game released by Atari in 1972. It is built using C++ and uses the BGI graphics library from Borland Software Inc. Once compiled in Borland Turbo C++ IDE, the executable will run natively on DOS. You can use DosBox to run the IDE and the compiled game.

You can also play a version of this game online at https://raghavmarwah.com/pong/
